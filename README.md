# library-management-system

My goal for this project is to implement OOP concepts, and show the OOP power  that allow us to solving hard problems in the best way. 
OOP also help us to write clean codes. 
<br/>
Because python is a class-base language and everything is an object, OOP is a important concept. I hope this project helps you to understand 
it.
